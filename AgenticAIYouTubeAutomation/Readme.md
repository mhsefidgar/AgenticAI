🚀 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝘆 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗿𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗧𝘂𝗯𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗜 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 (𝗖𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗼 & 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗸𝘀)

I am incredibly excited to share my latest project—an End-to-End Autonomous Agentic Pipeline that transforms a single stock ticker into a high-quality, narrated, and data-visualized YouTube video. No human intervention required.  
By leveraging LangGraph, I’ve moved beyond simple linear scripts to a state-aware, multi-agent system where specialized "agents" collaborate to handle everything from market analysis to final video editing.

🏗️ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 & 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲  
To bring this to life, I integrated a powerhouse of tools:  
Orchestration: LangGraph (StateGraph) for autonomous routing and state management.  
𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻: Gemini 3 Flash API for deep market analysis and creative scriptwriting.  
Data & Logic: Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for financial forecasting.  
𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀: MoviePy and OpenCV for dynamic chart animations and logo rendering.  
𝗔𝘂𝗱𝗶𝗼: Whisper AI and High-Fidelity TTS for professional narration.  
𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿: FFmpeg for seamless multi-track merging.  
🤖 𝗠𝗲𝗲𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗱  
I designed 5 specialized agents that pass the "state" back and forth:  
The Intro Designer: Renders high-end logo animations and visual themes.  
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝘁: The agent loads live data and generates predictive forecast visualizations. It collects a month of data for video analysis and a decade of data to predict a week ahead (a seven-day forecast).  
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿: A Gemini-powered creative that turns raw numbers into a compelling narrative.  
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗿: Handles the TTS, masters the audio, and mixes background music.  
𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗼𝗿: Performs the final quality check and merges all clips into a finished 4K product.  
💡 𝗪𝗵𝘆 "𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰"?  
The real magic is the Autonomous Router. Instead of a fixed path, the system examines its own status at every step. If a stage fails or needs a different path, the router decides where to go next, making the pipeline incredibly resilient and scalable.  
This project pushed me to think deeply about State Management in AI and how we can bridge the gap between "Generative AI" and "Automated Production."  
The future of content creation isn't just AI tools—it's AI Systems.

  <b>Project Demo: Ethereum Price Prediction</b><br>
  This video was fully generated by the Agentic Pipeline. It analyzes 30 days of 
  historical Ethereum data [00:00:26] and uses a machine learning model trained 
  on 10 years of data to forecast the next 7 days [00:02:14]. 
  The "Producer" agent handled the TTS narration and visual syncing automatically.

  <b>Project Demo: Bitcoin Price Prediction</b><br>
  In this run, the autonomous pipeline analyzed Bitcoin's late 2025 volatility, 
  noting the sharp recovery to $93,528 on December 3rd [00:01:05]. 
  The <b>Supervisor agent</b> successfully merged the historical analysis with 
  a 7-day forecast, predicting a moderate increase to <b>$90,157 by January 2nd, 2026</b> [00:03:20].
